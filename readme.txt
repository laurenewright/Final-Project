This website is my art portfolio.

This includes: 
    a gallery of different art pieces viewable as thumbnails or via a lightbox,
    an image link to my Redbubble online store,
    a simple about page,
    links to my social media profiles,
    a work in progress contact form, which for now has been disabled until I am able to impliment more functionality,
    and a submit button on the contact form, which once clicked displays an error message.

To view this project simple run index.html

I would like to thank the people behind Code Louisville for the opportunity to learn so much and the mentors for 
all their guidance and support.
